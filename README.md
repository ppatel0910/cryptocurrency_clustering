# Background

## You’ll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so you want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, you want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for your portfolio.
## When you present the idea, your manager loves it! So, you’re asked to create a prototype for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.


# What You're Creating
## You’ll combine your financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that you acquired in this module.

## You’ll create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. You’ll then plot the results so that you can visually show the performance to the board.

# Methodology:

1. Import the data
2. Prepare the data
3. Find the best value for k by using the original data
4. Cluster crytocurrencies with K-means by using the original data
5. Optimiza the clusters with principal component analysis
6. Find the best value for k using the PCA data
7. Cluster the crytocurrencies with K-means by using the PCA data
8. Visualize and compare the results

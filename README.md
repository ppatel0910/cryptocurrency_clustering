# Background

## You'll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in 
## the world. Competitors are fierce, so you want to propose a novel approach to assembling
## investment portfolios that are based on crytocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal 
## on only returns and volatility, you want to include other factors that might impact the 
## the crypto marketing-leading to better performace for your portfolio. 

## When you present the idea, your manager loves it! So, you're asked to create a prototype 
## for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

# What You're Creating
## You'll combine your financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning
## skills that you acquired in this module.

## You'll create a Jupyter notebook that clusters crytocurrencies by their performance in 
## different time periods. You'll then plot the results so that you can visually show the 
## performace to the board.
